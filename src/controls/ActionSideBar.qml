ActionSideBar
A global sidebar for the application window that can be collapsed.

The ActionSideBar is hanlded by a ListView, by default you would only need to declare
a list of Actions and those will be used as the model to populate the ListView.

By default the Actions delegate is a ListDelegate, you can use any other component.
For reference on how the collapsed sidebar is implemented for the delegate check
the default implementation as an exmaple.
